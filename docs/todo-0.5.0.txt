ElDewrito:
- implement stats submissions (find endgame hook (done, need to fix it up a bit though) + find unique gameID/matchID field)
- fix info server showing blank variant name
- fix info server still running after host joins a different game

DewritoLauncher:
- add URI protocol registration + rcon stuff (see SkeetLauncher source: http://pastebin.com/jHu9Rn3h)
- implement passworded server support to URI protocol (sample server browser does it like "dorito:127.0.0.1/password here", this isn't in skeetlauncher yet)
- allow the user to choose the update channel they want to use (channels.json on the update server will list the channel names and urls)

Master server:
- store stats data on at least one master, stats display site doesn't have to be ready yet.. but we MUST save peoples stats on at least one master
  ^ that way when we do have a stats display site ready we can display stats since the start of 0.5.0 release

Server browser:
- make proper server browser (WIP?)
- browser should be open source, that way we can put this server browser at the / route in master servers, and also host it locally
- use dewrito.json file to find the master servers to query and query all of them for server IPs, after querying + combining IP lists then contact each server

VoIp:
- SDK Documentation:          https://halowiki.llf.to/ts3_sdk/client_html/index.html
- Mute clients locally: (add button in D3d menu) https://halowiki.llf.to/ts3_sdk/client_html/ar01s24.html
- kick clients from teamspeak server
- D3d menu with microphone settings, Voice activation detection, auto gain control, mic volume, etc
- D3d menu with current list of people in VoIP with mute buttons (if server host, kick/gag!)
- D3d menu of current players should show their team color (or grey if non team game) also would be nice to determain if the player is dead or alive while talking (maybe put a skull next to their name)
- Add preferences and command arguments for changing and storing VoIP settings
- More to come.
- use upnp to port forward

Chat UI:
- fix users still being in the game IRC channel after they've left
- add a way for (server host/OP of game IRC channel) to kick everyone from the channel when server closes down
- fix chat UI showing game chat msgs on global chat tab
- fix chat UI showing the full string (PRIVMSG !dew1234 #haloonline : Hi there!) for some messages
- (possibly) make chat UI key mapped to the "Chat" ingame key (right now remapping ingame keys seems broke though, but I'm sure it worked fine before)
- add transparency
- add color codes
- fix mouse scrolling so that it works outside of game (need to register mouse raw input device)
- force chat ui to game chat when a game starts
- TEST TEST TEST the UI for bugs
