ElDorito is a dll-hook application to exploit the russian Halo Online game to enable features such as loading levels, disabling hud, and much more.
Simply extract the `iphlpapi.dll` and `run.bat` file into your Halo Online directory so that it is next to `eldorado.exe`.
Run the game using `run.bat` and a console window should start up parallel to the game where you may input commands. Input the `help` command to get started.
