ElDewrito:
- implement stats submissions (find endgame hook (done, need to fix it up a bit though) + find unique gameID/matchID field)
- fix info server showing blank variant name
- fix info server still running after host joins a different game
- fix users still being in the game IRC channel after they've left
- add a way for (server host/OP of game IRC channel) to kick everyone from the channel when server closes down
- fix chat UI showing game chat msgs on global chat tab
- also fix chat UI showing the full string (PRIVMSG !dew1234 #haloonline : Hi there!) for some messages
- and TEST TEST TEST the chat UI
- (possibly) make chat UI key mapped to the "Chat" ingame key (right now remapping ingame keys seems broke though, but I'm sure it worked fine before)
- add transparency
- fix mouse scrolling so that it works outside of game (need to register mouse raw input device)

DewritoLauncher:
- add URI protocol registration + rcon stuff (see SkeetLauncher source: http://pastebin.com/jHu9Rn3h)
- implement passworded server support to URI protocol (sample server browser does it like "dorito:127.0.0.1/password here", this isn't in skeetlauncher yet)
- allow the user to choose the update channel they want to use (channels.json on the update server will list the channel names and urls)

Master server:
- store stats data on at least one master, stats display site doesn't have to be ready yet.. but we MUST save peoples stats on at least one master
  ^ that way when we do have a stats display site ready we can display stats since the start of 0.5.0 release

Server browser:
- make proper server browser (WIP?)
- browser should be open source, that way we can put this server browser at the / route in master servers, and also host it locally
- use dewrito.json file to find the master servers to query and query all of them for server IPs, after querying + combining IP lists then contact each server
